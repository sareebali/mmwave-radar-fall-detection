The data (included in the repository) is in the form of csv files representing point cloud with each file representing one motion. The dataset, containing 102 datapoints, was collected using 3 subjects and 6 different kinds of motions (front fall, back fall, side fall, bow, squat and walk). 

The CNN Model is made using PyTorch (python machine learning library). It is trained and tested on the collected data. As an additional feature, it is also cross validated.

The results of the model are shown in the form of metrics and loss/accuracy graphs.

The model can also be tested on a new file.

All of the funcionalities described are included in the Jupyter Notebook.
